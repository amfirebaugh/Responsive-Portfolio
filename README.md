# Responsive-Portfolio

-In my HW1 I had used 3 style sheets, one per html file. So for HW2 I tried combining all of my styles into one CSS file. When I did this, my background image disappeared and I did some troubleshooting on this problem for at least a few hours with no success. Therefore I went back to using my 3 individual stylesheets, even though there is a lot of overlap.

-I will say my troubleshooting in general has improved greatly even in the course of one week, especially using the developer tools and inspecting a page. I'm still learning how to get better at using it, but it's amazing how much you learn in one week and working through these assignments over multiple days.

-I wasn't sure about the instruction on making sure the header (my navbar) "stick" for the smallest screen size in our media queries....I thought my layout already did what it's describing.

-This was more fun than I thought it would be. It's a very direct/easy way to see your CSS changes.
